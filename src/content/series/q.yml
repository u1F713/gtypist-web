      - intro: |+
          In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
          keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
          By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
          alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.

          If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
          is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
          look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
          to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
          tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)

          If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
          time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
          typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
          But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.

          If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
          fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.
